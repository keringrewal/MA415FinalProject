#Introduction {.flexbox .vcenter}

For this project I choose to analyze flights from six different cities to see if the weather directly impacts the delay time. I felt the timing was not ideal for this, because in America in April there is very little severe weather, so the biggest hinderances will likely be rain and fog, whereas in January or February you may find more issues with snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. My data for this project came from developer.flightstats.com, and I uesd both Flight Status & Track by Airport (departures), and Weather APIs. The flight tracking information goes from about 9:45 am to 3:45 pm on Wednesday, April 25th.


##Airports Used
Here are the airports I used. I selected them based off of their weather on April 25th, as I wanted to have a variety of temperatures and conditions. I used USA Today National Weather map to make my selections.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggmap(map1) + geom_point(data = df1, aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = location))

```


##Using the Afternoon Forecast {#slide1} 

The first data I used to examine the weather conditions was the afternoon forecast. Using text mining, I ranked each city's forecast as positive and negative. I then graphed the data, subtracting the negative words. I included a scaled down version of the delay minutes, to show how severe the average delay time was in contrast to the weather. The bars represent the weather, and points represent avg. delay.


##Good Forecast Data by City

```{r, echo= FALSE}
kable(good_weather, "html", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(height = "300px") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "float_left")

```
These words have have been chosen from the weather forecasts to represent good weather. The numbers, e.g. 5 and 10 represent wind speed, and are included because these are low wind speeds. 
The limitations of my data is that the forecasts are relatively short, and that means there are not many words in each and therefore ranking the weather based on these words is not completely accurate.

##Bad Forecast Data by City
```{r, echo= FALSE}
kable(bad_weather, "html", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(height = "300px") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "float_right")

```
These words have have been chosen from the weather forecasts to represent bad weather. The numbers, e.g. 20 and 30 represent wind speed, and are included because these are high wind speeds. 


```{r, fig.width = 4, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("www/rainy-day.jpg")
```

##Graph of Afternoon Weather Condition and Delay Time

The delay times have been scaled to appropriately fit the weather data.
The bars represent the weather conditions and the points represent the delays.
```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.5}

ggplot(delayAnalysis, aes(x = city)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (good-bad), color = city), stat="identity", fill="white") +
  geom_point(aes(y = delay/50, color = city)) +
  ylab("weather condition and severity of delay") +
  labs(title = "General Weather Forecast and Delay Minutes")
```


##Graph of Week-Long Weather Condition and Delay Time
The delay times have been scaled to appropriately fit the weather data.
The bars represent the weather conditions and the points represent the delays.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(delay_week, aes(x = city)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (good-bad), color = city), stat="identity", fill="white") +
  geom_point(aes(y = delay/10, color = city)) +
  ylab("weather condition and severity of delay") +
  labs(title = "Week-Long Weather Forecast and Delay Minutes") +
  ylim(-25, 25)

```
